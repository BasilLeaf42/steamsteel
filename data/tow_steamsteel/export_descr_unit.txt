;NOTES FOR SHUN: we talked about light inf a little, but i tried to make somewhat clear classes. anything with "(insert nation) infantry" or _____ line infantry usually refers to the line infantry class. Guards and Royal refer to elite/heavy infantry. Militia and Levy to low tier. Grenadiers will all throw grenades/explosives. Sharpshootersare of course sniper units. id like the sharpshooters to be small groups but very heavy attack. other than that enjoy!
