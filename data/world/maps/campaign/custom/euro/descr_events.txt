; historical events and when they occur
;
; Events are followed by a category, and a label
; labels are used as lookups into historic_events.txt for title and body strings,
; and also as image names for the event picture
;
; Currently supported categories are:
; counter  - just increase a counter
; historic - Just generates a message and increase a counter
; volcano  - triggers a volcano if there is one on the map at the position specified
; plague   - triggers a plague in settlements at the specified positions
; emergent_faction - triggers the emergence of the given faction.  This faction must be marked
;	as emergent in descr_strat.txt
;
; event descriptions are followed by a date (year as offset from starting date) or a date range
; and either a list of positions, or list of regions.  Each position/region specification must appear on
; a seperate line below the date


;test to correct the event format - verified, date is based on years (not turns!) correctly counting with 4TPY
