There's plenty of things connected to the map tiles in the current build, 
please make sure not to move any port locations or change their tiles (each port 
has its own custom battlemap tile). There are 8 wonders in the game so far, 
make sure not to edit their tiles as well. Keep in mind that every change to 
the terrain will affect custom battle locations. Some of them may no longer 
work after specific edits.

If you really need to change them, make sure to check everything before 
committing any changes. If you move ports go to:
data\world\maps\campaign\imperial_campaign\custom_tiles_db.txt 
and change coords of specific port to new ones. Also make sure to check
custom battle locations of the places you have edited. In this file you
can also check other custom tiles coords (for wonders etc.)

Thanks :)
