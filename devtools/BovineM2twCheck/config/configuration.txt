;Set DATAFOLDER to the data folder for your mod, such as C:/Games/M2TW/mods/my_mod_name/data

;When encountering a file (animation, sound, model etc) where it cannot see
;any usage, it gets reported as unused. You will probably want to actually
;reference it, but possibly you instead wish to remove it to reduce mod size.
;Provide commands for what to do with these below.
;Suggested variants below, not all of them will be relevant for you.
;Use this with caution, and ONLY after checking for possible typos in
;references and files that you really want to use in the mod after all!
;You can define more than one - this will cause each of them to be executed,
;in sequence. If you want to move to a backup folder, ensure that works
;properly before enabling the deletion command!

;The checker can be configured to require vanilla animations to be present in
;the mod's own animations folder. As this is the case for EB2, this is the
;default setting even if most mods can rely on vanilla animation files being
;available to the mod. Chances are that you want to uncomment the setting
;below for any other mod than EB2.
;VANILLA_ANIMATIONS_REQUIRED=NO

;The checker expects all hidden traits to use descriptions "hidden_desc" and 
;"hidden_effects_desc". Any hidden traits with specific descriptions are
;considered to be intended to be shown to the player and assigned as hidden by
;mistake. If your mod wishes to keep trait specific text even for hidden
;traits, uncomment this line below to suppress those reports.
;HIDDEN_TRAIT_DESCRIPTIONS_SUPPRESSED=YES

;The checker tries to match all sound file names with the accent it is used for.
;Any file names not matching the defined accent prefixes will be reported. If
;you are not doing voice modding or otherwise don't want these reports, you can
;suppress them by uncommenting the line below.
;ACCENT_PREFIXES_SUPPRESSED=YES

;The checker tries to match all referenced sound files with the file system.
;If all your sound files are packed rather than available as individual files,
;you want to suppress reports about missing files by uncommenting the line below.
;SOUNDFILE_INTEGRITY_SUPPRESSED=YES

;Some agent types may not be in use in your mod, despite them being part of
;some of your files. In this case you are probably encountering a bunch of
;reported issues that are not really relevant for you. You can enter any number
;of these agents here and their file references should not be checked. If you
;still get some reports concerning them, I may have forgot to check the config
;in some instances. Let me know in the forum.
