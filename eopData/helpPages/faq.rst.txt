.. glossary::
*Where can I download M2TWEOP?*
	The latest version of M2TWEOP is located on the "Releases" tab of the M2TWEOP github, here: https://github.com/youneuoy/M2TWEOP-library/releases. You need to download the archive with the word "M2TWEOP" in the title and the extension '.zip' (e.g M2TWEOP-beta-2.14.zip)

*How do I install M2TWEOP?*
	Just unpack the downloaded archive into the folder with your modification.

*I installed M2TWEOP. How can I run a modification using it?*
	Run M2TWEOPGUI.exe, specify your mods config file (e.g TATW.cfg) and hit 'Run Mod'.

*I heard that M2TWEOP allows you to write plugins in the lua programming language. How to do it?*
	Read https://youneuoy.github.io/M2TWEOP-library/_static/LuaLib/index.html or watch a tutorial here: https://youtu.be/hUvbcz8i7Wk

*How can I prevent users from running my mod without having EOP enabled?*
	You should run the M2TWEOP launcher, check the "Block modification launch without EOP" parameter in the settings ("game" submenu). Next, you should replace all "type" fields in your "export_descr_unit.txt" file with "eopOnlyType". After that, your mod will not work unless the user launches it with EOP.

*How can I use M2TWEOP and ReShade together?*
	1. Delete d3d9.dll in Medieval 2 folder if you have one there already
	2. Install ReShade like normal
	3. Rename d3d9.dll in Medieval 2 folder added by ReShade to dxgi.dll
	4. Run mod via M2TWEOP like normal

*How can I open the M2TWEOP Console, Reload the Script or use the Map Viewer?*
	* CTRL+1 = Open Console
	* CTRL+9+1 = Reloads `luaPluginScript.lua`
	* CTRL+2 = Open EOP Map Viewer

*How can I convert a non-EOP save to an EOP save?*
	1. Make a copy of your save
	2. Rename the copy to **M2TWEOPTEMPgameSaveDONTTOUCHTHISFILE.sav** (Make sure it ends in .sav and the file type is .sav)
	3. Compress it into a .zip archive
	4. Rename the .zip archive to something like *Bree.sav* (Make sure it ends in .sav and the file type is .sav)

*Does the mod increase the faction limit?*
	No. Removing the faction limit is complicated and will be extremely time consuming. It's not as simple as just changing the value. Perhaps in the future.

*What's the best way to write and debug EOP Lua scripts?*
	We suggest you use `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com>`_  and the following `extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua>`_ because it enables linting, Intellisense and inline documentation for each EOP function.
